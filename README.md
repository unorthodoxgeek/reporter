reporter
========

This gem, once ready, will be a customizable reporting mechanism which will receive a formula in pseudo code, which would translate into valid ruby and generate reports, either aggregated ones or reoccuring ones (daily, weekly, whatever) which would show trends in user behaviour, etc, using the data the application collects (should not matter from which souce, it can accept ruby code as well, and use data from sources like mongo/redis/whatever)

The goal, at the end, is to create sort of a ruby BI solution for the poor :)
